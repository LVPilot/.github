# LVPilot

LVPilot automates construction material sourcing.

Upload takeoff files (LV, CSV, XLS, PDF, Procore XML).  
We extract line items, compare supplier prices, and generate sourcing reports in seconds.

The goal is simple: less manual work, better pricing decisions.

## What it does

- Parses construction takeoffs and material lists

- Supports Procore XML workflows

No manual supplier checks. No spreadsheets glued together by hand.

## Supported Inputs
